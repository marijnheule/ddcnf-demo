This is the 2013 edition of:

cnfdd.c - delta debugger for CNFs in DIMACS format
cnfuzz.c - fuzzer for CNFs in DIMACS format

They both should be 64-bit clean, support QDIMACS, and option
fuzzing respectively delta debugging (see also our TAP'13 paper).

There was no change to:

mtcnfdd.c - multithreaded version (needs -pthread to compile)

See our SAT'2010 papers for more details and COPYING for the license.
